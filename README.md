# UM_PDRA - Unified Model for Post-Disaster Road Assessment Drone Routing

This repository implements the **Unified Model (UM)** proposed in the paper *"A Unified Model for Multi-Task Drone Routing in Post-Disaster Road Assessment"*, aiming to solve multi-task drone routing optimization for post-disaster road damage assessment.

## Problem Statement

Given a road network affected by disaster, deploy a fleet of drones to:
- Maximize collected damage information across the road network
- Complete assessment within time constraints
- Respect battery flight time limits

## Problem Variants

The problem can be extended to 8 PDRA variants through attribute combinations:

| Variant | Open Route (OR) | Time Window (TW) | Multi-Depot (MD) |
|---------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| PDRA-Basic |   |   |   |
| PDRA-OR | ✓ |   |   |
| PDRA-TW |   | ✓ |   |
| PDRA-OR-TW | ✓ | ✓ |   |
| PDRA-MD |   |   | ✓ |
| PDRA-OR-MD | ✓ |   | ✓ |
| PDRA-TW-MD |   | ✓ | ✓ |
| PDRA-OR-TW-MD | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**Attribute Descriptions:**
- **OR (Open Route)**: Drones do not need to return to depot, can land at any feasible location
- **TW (Time Window)**: Critical road segments must be assessed before specified deadlines
- **MD (Multi-Depot)**: Drones can launch from multiple depot locations

## Model Architecture

The unified model processes road network data, problem parameters, and variant attributes through five main components: 
- (1) **Input** layer embeds node features and problem configurations, distinguishing road network nodes and depot nodes; 
- (2) **Encoder** transforms embeddings into high-level contextual representations using modern transformer layers with RMS normalization, FlashAttention, and SGLUFFN; 
- (3) **Decoder** constructs solutions autoregressively through probability computation, softmax selection, and single-head attention mechanisms; 
- (4) **Update** module maintains solution feasibility by managing infeasible action masks, active drone indices, and current time states; 
- (5) **Output** produces feasible multi-drone routes satisfying variant-specific constraints with appropriate termination conditions.

## Key Features

- **Rapid Performance**: 1-10 seconds inference time vs. 100-2,000 seconds for traditional methods
- **Superior Solution Quality**: Outperforms commercial solvers (Gurobi) and traditional heuristics
- **No Domain Expertise Required**: Eliminates need for hand-crafted algorithms through end-to-end learning
- **Strong Generalization**: Robust performance across varying problem scales, drone numbers, and time constraints
- **Multi-task Learning**: Handles diverse parameter combinations in a unified framework
- **8× Efficiency**: Consolidates 8 PDRA variants in one model, reducing training time and parameters by 8-fold
- **Adaptive to New Attributes**: Lightweight adapter mechanism enables efficient incorporation of unseen attributes (e.g., multi-depot settings) without full retraining

## Technical Highlights

### Key Innovations

1. **Network Transformation**: Converts link-based routing problems (assessing road segments) into node-based formulations to eliminate ambiguity and reduce computational complexity.

2. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Addresses large-scale training dataset scarcity by generating realistic road network instances (grid initialization → link pruning → node perturbation).

3. **Attention-based Encoder-Decoder**: Uses Transformer architecture to learn optimal routing strategies end-to-end via deep reinforcement learning (DRL).

4. **Multi-task Learning**: Handles simultaneous training across varying drone numbers and time constraints, eliminating the need for separate models per parameter combination.

5. **Modern Transformer Architecture**: Incorporates RMS normalization, pre-normalization configuration, FlashAttention, and SGLUFFN for enhanced computational efficiency and solution quality.

6. **Lightweight Finetuning**: Adapter mechanism enables efficient incorporation of new attributes (e.g., multi-depot) with minimal computational cost while preserving pre-trained knowledge.
